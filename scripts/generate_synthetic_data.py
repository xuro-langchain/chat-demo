APR (Annual Percentage Rate): Yearly cost of borrowing including interest and fees

- Balance transfer APR: Rate on transferred balances
- Cash advance APR: Rate on cash advances (typically higher)
- Penalty APR: Higher rate applied for late payments
Variable vs Fixed APR:
- Variable APR: Changes based on Prime Rate
- Fixed APR: Rate stays same but can be changed with notice
- Most credit cards have variable APR
Current APR shown on:
- Monthly statement (top section)
- Online banking account summary
- Card agreement terms and conditions
Tell customer: Interest charges can be avoided by paying full balance by due date
Interest only charged on carried balances, not paid-in-full amounts
Making only minimum payment results in significant interest charges over time""",
            """How Credit Card Interest is Calculated
Interest calculation method: Average Daily Balance
Daily balance calculation:
- Add all daily balances in billing cycle
- Divide by number of days in cycle
- Multiply by daily periodic rate (APR ÷ 365)
- Result is interest charge for that cycle
Example calculation:
- Balance: $1,000
- APR: 18.99%
- Daily rate: 18.99% ÷ 365 = 0.052%
- Days in cycle: 30
- Interest charge: $1,000 × 0.052% × 30 = $15.60
Important factors affecting interest:
- When payments are made (earlier is better)
- New purchases add to daily balance
- Cash advances accrue interest immediately (no grace period)
- Different balances may have different APRs
Avoiding interest charges:
- Pay full statement balance by due date
- Pay more than minimum payment
- Avoid cash advances when possible
- Take advantage of 0% promotional offers""",
            """Common Fees and Fee Waivers
Standard credit card fees:
Late payment fee:
- $29 for first late payment
- $40 for subsequent late payments within 6 months
- Charged when minimum payment not received by due date
- Can negatively impact credit score
Returned payment fee:
- $29 if payment returned due to insufficient funds
- May also incur late payment fee
- Check with bank before making payment if concerned about funds
Over-limit fee:
- Most cards no longer charge over-limit fees
- Transactions may be declined if over limit
- Must opt-in to allow over-limit transactions
Foreign transaction fee:
- 3% of transaction amount for purchases made outside US
- Applies to online purchases from foreign merchants
- Some cards have no foreign transaction fee
Requesting fee waiver:
- Can request one-time courtesy waiver for late/returned payment fee
- More likely granted if:
  * First time occurrence
  * Long history of on-time payments
  * Account in good standing
- Call customer service to request
- Not guaranteed but often approved for good customers

    elif "reward" in question_topic.lower():
        return "Rewards points are earned on eligible purchases based on card type, with rates ranging from 1 to 5 points per dollar spent. Points can be redeemed for cash back (as statement credit, direct deposit, or check), travel bookings, gift cards, or merchandise. Points never expire as long as the account remains open and in good standing, with a minimum redemption amount of 2,500 points. Points can be combined between eligible cards on the same account and transferred instantly once confirmed, though points cannot be transferred between different customers or after account closure."
    elif "activat" in question_topic.lower():
        return "New cards must be activated before use and can be activated through the mobile app, online banking, phone, or ATM. Cards should be activated within 30 days of receipt and will be automatically deactivated after 45 days if not activated. Activation is instant after successful verification and the old card will be automatically deactivated when a new card is activated. Common activation issues include incorrect card information entry, browser cache problems, or security holds that may require contacting customer service."

        return "Accounts are monitored 24/7 for suspicious activity with automated systems analyzing purchase patterns, locations, amounts, and high-risk merchants. Customers receive alerts via text, email, mobile app, or phone call for high-risk transactions. Under zero liability protection, customers are not responsible for unauthorized transactions if they report unauthorized charges promptly and have taken reasonable care of their card. Lost or stolen cards should be reported immediately through the mobile app, online banking, phone, or branch to prevent fraud, and provisional credit is issued within 10 business days."
    elif "balance transfer" in question_topic.lower():
        return "Balance transfers allow moving debt from other credit cards to take advantage of promotional APR offers and consolidate multiple card balances. There is typically a 3% or 5% balance transfer fee (minimum $5) and the transfer amount plus fee cannot exceed available credit. Balance transfers take 7-14 business days to complete and can be requested online, by phone, or through the mobile app. Promotional APR applies from the date of transfer posting and making minimum payments on time is required to keep the promotional rate."
    elif "credit limit" in question_topic.lower():
        return "Credit limit increases can be requested through online banking, mobile app, or phone after the account has been open for at least 6 months with no late payments. Factors considered include payment history, credit utilization ratio, debt-to-income ratio, and overall creditworthiness. The bank may also automatically increase limits periodically for accounts in good standing without requiring a hard credit inquiry. Credit limits can also be decreased based on payment delinquency, decreased credit score, or account inactivity, with customers receiving notification before the decrease takes effect."
    elif "statement" in question_topic.lower():
        return "Statements are available through online banking (up to 7 years), mobile app, or delivered by mail within 3-5 business days after the cycle closes. Electronic statements are available 24 hours after the cycle closes and can be downloaded in PDF format. The statement cycle typically covers 28-31 days and the payment due date is 21-25 days after the statement date. Customers can switch between paper and electronic statements in account preferences and can request a due date change once per year."

        return "APR (Annual Percentage Rate) represents the yearly cost of borrowing and includes purchase APR, balance transfer APR, cash advance APR, and penalty APR. Interest is calculated using the average daily balance method, where daily balances are added throughout the billing cycle, divided by the number of days, and multiplied by the daily periodic rate. Common fees include late payment fees ($29-$40), returned payment fees ($29), and foreign transaction fees (3%). Customers can request one-time courtesy fee waivers for late or returned payment fees, especially if it's a first occurrence and the account has a history of on-time payments."

        return "Lost or stolen cards should be reported immediately through online banking, mobile app, or phone (available 24/7) to prevent unauthorized charges. A temporary card lock can be used when a card is misplaced but might be found, while permanent deactivation is used when the card is truly lost or stolen. When a card is permanently deactivated, a new card is issued automatically with expedited shipping available (2-3 business days), and virtual card numbers can be generated instantly through the mobile app. Customers are not liable for fraudulent charges after reporting and emergency cash advances are available at any branch location."
