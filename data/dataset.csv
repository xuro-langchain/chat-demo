If rewards are redeemed through Chase, discuss reward redemption options with customer
If applicable, process redemption or combine points with eligible account before processing account closure
Disney accounts:
All voluntary account closures forfeit existing Disney Rewards Dollars after 30 days
Whenever possible, offer to transfer Disney Rewards Dollars that meet transfer minimums before closing account
Minimum initial transfer amount to cardmember's first Disney Rewards Redemption Card is 20 Disney Rewards Dollars
Subsequent transfers to Redemption Card require minimum of 10 Disney Rewards Dollars
Credit Journey:
Terminating a Chase relationship by closing an account does not un-enroll customer from Credit Journey
If customer wants to un-enroll: See Credit Journey
Branch representatives requesting account closure on customer's behalf must be authenticated; see Connect Us
Disclose account status:
It's important we disclose account status to make sure customers / branch representatives understand how their card is impacted by account statuses
If you're receiving transferred call from another specialist, you don't need to re-disclose status
Only disclose closed status if closure occurred less than 30 days ago","Account closure can occur for various reasons, including voluntary customer closure, bank policy closure, account rejection, and adverse action closures. Customers may request account closure through different channels such as Secure Message Center, email, correspondence, or phone. It is important to select the correct closure reasons in the Retention tab to help the bank understand why customers choose to close their accounts. Rewards can be redeemed for at least 30 days after account closure if the account is in good standing. Some accounts closed by bank policy may be eligible for reinstatement, but generally, accounts closed due to adverse actions or rewards misuse are not eligible for reinstatement. If a customer requests reinstatement, they must write to the Executive Office. For business accounts, only the authorizing officer or branch representative can request closure, and specific documentation may be required if the authorizing officer is unavailable.

account closure,"Account closure reasons in Retention tab
It is important to select the correct closure reasons in the Retention tab when closing an account so that the bank can learn why customers choose to close their accounts.
Following the three components of a retention call allows us to determine why the customer wants to close their account.
New closure reasons
Explanation
None
Do not select this closure reason
Pricing: Annual Percentage Rate (APR) too high
Customer said their APR is too high
Rewards: Product no longer relevant to customer
Product is no longer relevant to the customer (e.g., SWA or United customer moved out of a hub city, Disney customer is no longer going to Disney or spending on Disney products)
Rewards: Change in rewards program
Rewards structure has been modified in a manner which upsets the customer (e.g., devaluation of rewards earned but not redeemed, reduced redemption options)
Rewards: Finds better value elsewhere
Customer said they earn better rewards elsewhere
Prefers: Using cash / checks / debit cards
Customer doesn't want to use credit cards anymore
Prefers: Another bank due to existing relationship
Customer closed their Chase card and keep competitor cards open since they have other banking relationships with that credit card issuer (e.g., checking account, mortgage, auto loan)
Dissatisfaction: Bad customer / service experience
Customer wants to close due to a bad customer service experience with Chase
Important: If it is a bad customer service experience with the partner select Dissatisfaction: with partner.
Dissatisfaction: Credit limit insufficient
Credit limit is too low for the customer
If customer not eligible for credit line increase and has another credit card, line consolidation can be offered onto the card they called to close
Do not proactively offer to consolidate credit line on closed account to another credit card
Dissatisfaction: With partner
Customer is upset with the partner (e.g.","Account closure can occur for various reasons, including voluntary customer closure, bank policy closure, account rejection, and adverse action closures. Customers may request account closure through different channels such as Secure Message Center, email, correspondence, or phone. It is important to select the correct closure reasons in the Retention tab to help the bank understand why customers choose to close their accounts. Rewards can be redeemed for at least 30 days after account closure if the account is in good standing. Some accounts closed by bank policy may be eligible for reinstatement, but generally, accounts closed due to adverse actions or rewards misuse are not eligible for reinstatement. If a customer requests reinstatement, they must write to the Executive Office. For business accounts, only the authorizing officer or branch representative can request closure, and specific documentation may be required if the authorizing officer is unavailable.

closure,"What are delayed closure: Reasons
Adding delayed closure:
Rush replacement card offer was declined or doesn't otherwise meet customer's needs
Customer has Private Label account (where we cannot offer rush cards) and their specific situations dictate need to delay closure
Customer placed order that hasn't been charged to account yet
Customer has pending balance transfer or access check and account reported lost / stolen
Customer specifically requests that closure be delayed
Customer calls regarding fraudulent transactions on their account and confirms they need to continue use of their card until new card received:
Mostly travel related
Example: Customer is stranded, rush replacement card can't be sent and they need their card to get home
Example: There are transactions in California they didn't make but they're on vacation in London and their daughter is using her card in New York City
Modifying delayed closure:
Customer calls to notify Chase that their flight home has been cancelled and they will need to use their account for additional days
Removing delayed closure:
Customer calls to notify Chase replacement card has been received and no longer need ability to use old account which has delayed closure established","Account closures can occur for various reasons, including bank-initiated closures due to adverse actions or incomplete information, voluntary closures by customers, or closures due to bank policy.

Available credit and cash won't display after closure in First Assist, C3 or customer's billing statement:
Reinstated accounts will have credit available immediately; see Account reinstatement
Only liable party (Primary, Secondary or Authorizing Officer) or Power of Attorney can request account closure; see POA / Agent inquiries for authority levels to determine POA can request Account closure
Consumer and Business accounts:
Branch representative requesting closure only: Customer presence isn't required as long as branch representative verbally confirms customer was high-risk authenticated before calling for account closure
Business accounts:
Business accounts may only be closed by authorizing officer or Branch Representative; see Customer entitlement matrix and go to Process account closure
If authorizing officer's account is closed, business user account and all employee accounts are also closed
If business card owner states no longer using account for business use, see Non-business use - account closure
Employee accounts:
Closing employee accounts are completed by using Remove User workflow; see Add / remove employees, proxy, or authorized nonuser
Employees may only request to remove themselves
Proxy can close any employee account
Rewards:
If rewards are redeemed through Chase, they are available for at least 30 days from date account is closed or they are lost
If rewards are redeemed through partner loyalty program, they are transferred to partner
Before rewards are used or transferred, they can be lost for program misuse, fraudulent activities or other reasons described in rewards program terms and conditions
Best practice is to:
Tell customer current rewards balance
If rewards are redeemed through Chase, discuss reward redemption options with customer
If applicable, process redemption or combine points with eligible account before processing account closure
Disney accounts:
All voluntary account closures forfeit existing Disney Rewards Dollars after 30 days
Whenever possible, offer to transfer Disney Rewards Dollars that meet transfer minimums before closing account
Minimum initial transfer amount to cardmember's first Disney Rewards Redemption Card is 20 Disney Rewards Dollars
Subsequent transfers to Redemption Card require minimum of 10 Disney Rewards Dollars
Credit Journey:
Terminating a Chase relationship by closing an account does not un-enroll customer from Credit Journey
If customer wants to un-enroll: See Credit Journey
Branch representatives requesting account closure on customer's behalf must be authenticated; see Connect Us
Disclose account status:
It's important we disclose account status to make sure customers / branch representatives understand how their card is impacted by account statuses
If you're receiving transferred call from another specialist, you don't need to re-disclose status

Wording suggestions
Why the customer is closing the account
(Understanding why the customer want to close their account can be used to shape the rest of the conversation. This can help to identify customer awareness gaps and understand how they perceive the card.)I am so sorry to hear that you want to close your account
May I ask:

What led to the decision to close your account?
Why do you want to close your account?
What factors led to that decision?
What the customer values in a credit card
(The foundation of a successful retention conversation is an understanding of what the customer values. Everything else in the conversation should spring from this knowledge. Using open-ended probing questions is an incredibly important tool.)Other than APR / annual fee / rewards, what else:
Is important to you in a credit card?
Makes you use other credit cards?
When you use a credit card, what prompts you to use it?
Relevant engagement
(This is the portion of the call when we take what we have learned about our customer and show how the benefits of their card meet those needs. The goal here is to help the customer see how these benefits are relevant and useful in their situation.)Those are great benefits, it sounds like saving money / convenience is very important to you and here is how this card can help you achieve that

Some accounts may be eligible for reinstatement, depending on the closure reason and bank error. Rewards can often be redeemed for a period after closure if the account is in good standing. Closure reasons are important for understanding customer behavior and improving services. Delayed closures may be applied in specific situations, such as pending transactions or fraudulent activity. Closure requests can be made through various channels, including phone, email, or correspondence, and must follow specific procedures to ensure proper handling.","['What are Bank initiated closures\nRemember: Some accounts might be eligible for reinstatement; see corresponding procedures for proper handling\nCorrespondence / Email Specialists: Tell customer account has been closed and if they need more information regarding closure to call Chase\nAdverse action closures: Account that is closed due to adverse action\nBased on information provided to us or account behavior\nCall handling: If customer wants more information about adverse action account closure reasons, cold transfer customer according to information below or found in account memo; see Internal transfer numbers\nAccount is not eligible for reinstatement\nCustomer Identification Program closure (CIP): Chase is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies who opens an account.
